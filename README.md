`dotnet run "replace_with_username" "replace_with_password" "replace_with_auth_company_domain e.g. access.domain.com" "replace_with_your_application_url_where_your_login_button_resides" "replace_with_id_of_your_login_button"`

## Playwright
To run the project from the command line, naivgate to the Playwright directory in the codebase via the command line and run the following command:
